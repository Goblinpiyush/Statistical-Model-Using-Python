üîçThis project aims to analyze a dataset of music tracks to understand which audio features influence track popularity. By cleaning and exploring the data, we provide insights into the relationships between various features and popularity scores.

üíªDataset
The dataset includes attributes such as:

Track Information: Track Name, Artists, Album Name
Popularity Score: A metric indicating the track's popularity
Audio Features: Danceability, Energy, Loudness, Acousticness, Valence, and other metrics
Explicit Content: Indicator of whether a track contains explicit content
Project Steps
1. Data Loading and Initial Inspection
We began by loading the dataset and inspecting its structure to understand its columns, types, and the general shape of the data.

2. Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process involved:

Dropping irrelevant columns (e.g., unnamed index columns).
Handling missing values by filling in placeholders for columns like Track Name, Artists, and Album Name.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this step, we explored:

Popularity Distribution: Visualized the distribution of popularity scores to understand the frequency and range.
Correlation Analysis: Generated a heatmap to observe relationships between popularity and other numerical audio features.
4. Feature Analysis
We examined the relationships between popularity and specific audio features:

Danceability and Energy: Assessed whether higher energy or danceable tracks correlate with popularity.
Loudness and Valence: Analyzed if louder, more positive tracks tend to be more popular.
Acousticness: Evaluated the role of acoustic elements in popular tracks.
Insights
Based on our analysis, we derived insights on which features might contribute more significantly to a track‚Äôs popularity. This understanding can inform recommendations for music producers or streaming platforms.

üìäConclusion
This analysis provided a foundation for understanding how audio features affect track popularity. Further analysis or model building could involve deeper statistical modeling to predict popularity based on audio attributes.
